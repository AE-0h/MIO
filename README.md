# MIO ⚠️(W.I.P)

A decentralized digital public square using IPFS, where all posts are stored for 24-hours unless you “Make It Official” on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet, otherwise they are wiped from the Dapp entirely. Users are given an ID number, generated by Chainlink’s VRF. This is used to create deterministic addresses for NFT contracts generated by the user using the CREATE2 Opcode.

## How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `forge build` to build the contracts
4. Run `npx hardhat test` to run the tests
