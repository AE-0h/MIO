# MIO ⚠️(W.I.P)

A decentralized digital public square using IPFS, where all posts are stored for 24-hours unless you “Make It Official” on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet, otherwise they are wiped from the Dapp entirely. Users can also create new NFT contracts generated by the nft contract factory and then promote there new collections via the public square or Making it Official. 

## How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `forge build` to build the contracts
4. Run `npx hardhat test` to run the tests
