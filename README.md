# MIO ⚠️(W.I.P)

<img src="public/MIOICO.svg" size="100px" >

A decentralized digital public square where users can interact with one another using IPFS and Polygon Mumbai testnet. All posts are stored on IPFS for 24-hours unless you “Make It Official” on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet, otherwise they are wiped from storage entirely. Users can also create new NFT contracts generated by the nft contract factory and then promote minting from their new collections via the public square.

## How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALCHEMY_ID="YOUR_ALCHEMY_ID"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVATE_KEY_TWO="YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_TWO"
NEXT_PUBLIC_MIOCORE_ADDRESS="YOUR_MIOCORE_ADDRESS"
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_SECRET="YOUR_IPFS_SECRET"
NEXT_PUBLIC_IPFS_ID="YOUR_IPFS_ID"

```

4. Run `npx hardhat test` to run the tests
5. Run `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai` to deploy the contracts to the mumbai testnet
6. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
